<!-- This is a simple HTML template for a CPP Institute course dashboard. It includes sections for courses, exams, and resources. The script at the bottom dynamically fetches course and exam data from an API and displays it on the page. Make sure to replace the API endpoints with your actual data source
and customize the styles as needed. -->
<!-- Note: This template assumes you have a backend API that provides course and exam data in JSON format. Adjust the fetch URLs accordingly. -->
<!-- You can also enhance this template by adding user authentication, progress tracking, and other features as needed. -->
<!-- Remember to test the functionality of the dynamic content loading and ensure that the API endpoints return the expected data structure. -->
<!-- This template is a starting point and can be expanded with additional features such as user profiles, course completion tracking, and more. -->
<!-- Feel free to modify the layout, styles, and scripts to fit your specific requirements and design preferences. -->
<!-- Make sure to validate the HTML and ensure it meets accessibility standards for a better user experience. -->
<!-- You can also consider adding error handling for the fetch requests to manage cases where the API might not respond or return an error. -->
